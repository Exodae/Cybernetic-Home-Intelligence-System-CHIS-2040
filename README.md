# Cybernetic Home Intelligence System (CHIS) – 2040

CHIS 2040 is a **futuristic smart home SQL project** imagining a neural-linked AI home system in the year 2040.  
It showcases **SQL database design, sample data, and queries** for AI devices, biometric logs, and environment control.

## Project Concept
In 2040, homes include:
- NeuralLink devices for cognitive syncing  
- HoloDisplays for immersive interfaces  
- BioSensor drones for monitoring vital signs  
- AI Butler drones for environment control

The database includes:
- Devices (`devices_2040`)  
- Biometric inputs (`bio_inputs`)  
- Environment states (`environment_states`)  
- AI decisions (`ai_decisions`)

## How to Use
1. Import `schema.sql` to create tables.  
2. Import `sample_data.sql` to add sample data.  
3. Run queries from `queries.sql` to explore AI insights and futuristic analytics.

## Example Queries
- Top AI devices by intelligence  
- Rooms with high stress levels  
- AI actions triggered by stress  
- Average room temperature
